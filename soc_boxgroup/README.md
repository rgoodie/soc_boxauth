#soc Box Group
Drupal 7 module to sync user list between a box folder and an organic group. 



# Depends on 
- [og](https://drupal.org/project/og)
- [og_ui](https://drupal.org/project/og_ui)
- soc_boxauth

# Important
Ensure that you have a Content Type already created (how about "Group") and that it is marked as an Organic Group. This is very important. It will install a field called `soc_boxgroup_folder`

# To install 
- [Install parent module](../README.md) and get comfortable doing the oauth routine. Ensure you have the token.
